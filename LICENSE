-BEGIN EXTERNAL LICENSE CLAUSE-
Modification in simple terms: Anything under the /boxes/ directory is subject to their own individual licenses.

As this project is based on a directory structure any code, assets, or other content inside the dirctory/directories
which contain the file called

.MIT-LICENSE-BOUNDARY

and any subdirectories therein are not covered by this license. Please see each subproject in that directory for
license information of those.

You are not allowed to remove the .MIT-LICENSE-BOUNDARY file(s) from subsequent redistributions of this project
without first making sure that, in by doing so, all code within is allowed to be licensed under this license.

If you move any code, assets or other content from a directory which is not covered by this license to a directory
that would be covered by this license, you must first add a new .MIT-LICENCE-BOUNDARY and include the appropriate
license for the copied code, assets or other content.

If you distribute this project without any directories containing a file called .MIT-LICENSE-BOUNDARY, you
may remove this external license clause from subsequent redistributions of this project.

This external license clause is definded as the text between the line that state the beginning of the external license clause,
the line that state the end of the external license clause. And those two lines themselves.

A personal plea:
To any lawyers reading this: I've tried to make my intentions as clear as possible. I am not a lawyer and this is
a hobby project for me. Please note that if you're trying to use a technicality in this license to acquire
use of code I do not have the right to change the license of, you also don't have the right to use this faulty
license to do that. Please try to not use technicalities and legal jargon I neither understand nor know about
to circumvent the intent of this external license clause.
